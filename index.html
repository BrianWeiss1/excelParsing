                CyberPatriot is a national youth cyber education program created by the Air Force Association (AFA) to inspire K-12 students toward careers in cybersecurity or other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines critical to our nation’s future 12. The program was founded in 2009 as a proof-of-concept demonstration at AFA’s Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida 2. Since then, it has grown into a comprehensive program that includes a variety of initiatives aimed at promoting cyber education and awareness among young people.

                At the core of the CyberPatriot program is the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, which is the nation’s largest cyber defense competition that puts high school and middle school students in charge of securing virtual networks 12. The competition is now in its sixteenth season and is open to all high schools, middle schools, and accredited home school programs around the country 2. JROTC units of all Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, and Naval Sea Cadet Corps divisions may also participate in the competition 2. The competition is designed to teach students about cybersecurity and provide them with hands-on experience in defending against cyber attacks 2.
